How to execute the DNN classifier in the singularity container:

1. install container via `singularity pull docker://icecube/icetray:combo-stable-tensorflow.1.13.2-ubuntu18.04`. If you
   run into quota problems set SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR and SINGULARITY_TEMPDIR to a location where enough space is
   available  (/data/user/your_name/temp and /data/user/your_name/cache for example)
2. Create a script that is setting up the environment and make sure that the path to the package is included in you PYTHONPATH
   (see singularity_env.sh as an example)
(2.5. Make sure that you are on a machine with avx support and - if needed - have a gpu available)
3. Run `bash /path/to/singularity/envirnoment.sh /path/to/icetray/script.py [arguments]`


Example:
bash /data/user/tglauch/i3deepice/examples/singularity_env.sh /data/user/tglauch/i3deepice/examples/example1.py
--outfile /data/user/tglauch/test.npy --files /data/user/reimann/2017_07_25/diffuse_sample_for_ps/IC86_2012/processed/11029/11029_1.i3.bz2


Remark: Running on GPU machines
For running the script on GPU machines make sure that both - AVX support and CUDA - are available on the machine.
See gpu_job.sub for an example of how to set the condor variables correctly. For testing it is wise to use and interactive GPU by
running condor_submit -interactive gpu_job.sub
